# GestureSense: AI-Powered Image Recognition and Gesture Control üåü

![GestureSense Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=GestureSense+AI+Project)

GestureSense is an AI-driven project designed to revolutionize human-computer interaction. By leveraging **OpenCV** and machine learning, this system recognizes objects and hand gestures in real-time. It allows for a seamless, touchless interface with potential applications in automation, gaming, accessibility, and more.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Real-time hand gesture detection**: Detects gestures like hand waves, fist bumps, and other actions, enabling touchless control.
- **Object recognition**: Identifies common objects like pens, apples, and mobile phones with bounding boxes.
- **Multi-person recognition**: Adjusts the bounding box color based on different users for personalized interaction.
- **Intuitive interface**: Offers a smooth, interactive UI with labels for gestures and objects in the video feed.
- **Expandable design**: Easily integrates with other systems for further use cases, such as gesture-based automation or gaming controls.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time computer vision and image processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Used for object and gesture classification.
- **TensorFlow**: (If applicable) For training custom models.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Used for fast object detection.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Custom algorithms built using OpenCV for real-time hand detection and classification.

## Project Workflow üöÄ

1. **Real-Time Object Detection**: Using OpenCV and YOLO, the system can recognize objects like apples, pens, and mobile phones in real-time. These objects are tracked with bounding boxes, and labels are displayed dynamically on the screen.
   
2. **Hand Gesture Recognition**: The system detects common hand gestures such as waving or shaking hands, capturing the action and displaying the corresponding label.
   
3. **User Detection**: The project incorporates facial recognition, changing the color of bounding boxes when different users are detected.

## Installation and Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GestureSense.git
cd GestureSense
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and `pip` installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Project:

```bash
python main.py
```

> **Note**: Ensure you have a webcam connected for real-time detection.

### 4. Dependencies:

- **OpenCV**: Install using `pip install opencv-python`.
- **TensorFlow**: (Optional) Install using `pip install tensorflow` if using custom models.
- **PyTorch**: If using YOLO for object detection.

## How It Works üîß

### Object Detection:
Using **YOLO**, objects in the video feed are detected and classified based on the pre-trained model. Bounding boxes are drawn dynamically around detected objects, and labels are applied with confidence levels.

### Gesture Recognition:
Using **OpenCV**, the system analyzes hand movements and classifies gestures such as waving or making a fist. The detected gestures are displayed on the screen in real-time.

## Future Scope üåê

GestureSense has wide-ranging potential, with future enhancements such as:

- Adding more complex hand gestures.
- Integrating voice recognition for hybrid touchless interfaces.
- Expanding the object database for broader use cases.
- Improving multi-person interaction to adjust gestures dynamically.
